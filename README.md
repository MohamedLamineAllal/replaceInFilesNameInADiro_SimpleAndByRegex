# replaceInFilesNameInADiro_SimpleAndByRegex
A script that allow to apply a replace function, like with strings. 
But here we do it on files names of a given diro, and sub diro, with parametrisation for those choice. 
The replace function use two matching ways. 
A simple search (just like replace() funciton python), and regex search mode (using regex methods, it's based on re.sub())). 
Are you bored of doing replacemnet in multiple file in a diro or multiple nested diro. This script just do that.
A gui will be cool too (to include with the project).

How to use (to be write later! hhh now just open the source and guess how it work. it's simple stright forward!)
